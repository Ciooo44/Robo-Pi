# robo-pi

**Goal**: Close the hardwareâ†”software gap for small robot builders with a minimal browser SDK and a plugâ€‘andâ€‘play dashboard.

Zapier for Robots ðŸ¤–âš¡

Robo-Pi is an open-source SDK + dashboard monorepo that closes the gap between robot hardware and software for small builders.

Why?

Today, makers, students, and small robotics teams face a recurring pain point:

They can wire up the hardware (servos, motors, sensors).

They can code the software (simulations, AI).
But they struggle to connect the two worlds in a fast and standard way.

Every robot comes with its own SDK, setup takes weeks, and integration is fragile.

Robo-Pi solves this by acting like Zapier for Robots:

Use findPort() to detect and connect to your robot.

Run calibrate() with visual feedback.

Control joints live with teleoperate() from the browser.

Build data pipelines with record() â†’ train() â†’ eval() for AI-driven policies.

All from one unified API and a plug-and-play web dashboard.

Features

âœ… WebSerial-based robot detection
âœ… Visual dashboard with device registry
âœ… One-click calibration & teleoperation panel
âœ… MockBot support for testing without hardware
ðŸš§ Dataset recording & replay (record/replay)
ðŸš§ AI training (train)
ðŸš§ AI inference (eval)

Who is it for?

Maker & hobbyist communities

University / high school robotics clubs

Small robotics startups

Research labs

Development
pnpm i
pnpm -r build
pnpm --filter @robopi/dashboard dev


Open in your browser â†’ click Add Unit â†’ connect a robot or try with MockBot.

Roadmap
